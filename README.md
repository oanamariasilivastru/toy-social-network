# JavaFX Social Network Project with PostgreSQL Database

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a JavaFX application that serves as a social network platform. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to interact with various social features. Key components of the project include user authentication with encrypted password storage, friend request functionality, acceptance/decline of friend requests, and messaging capabilities with friends. The project utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage and management.

## Components

1. **Login System**: Users can log in securely using their username and password. Passwords are encrypted and stored in the PostgreSQL database, ensuring data security.

2. **Friend Request Management**: Users can send friend requests to other users and receive incoming friend requests. They have the option to accept or decline friend requests.

3. **Messaging Feature**: Once users become friends, they can initiate and participate in conversations. The messaging functionality allows users to communicate with their friends within the application.

4. **GUI Interface**: The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using JavaFX, providing an intuitive and visually appealing environment for users to navigate and interact with the social network features.

5. **PostgreSQL Database Integration**: The project integrates with a PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval of user data, friend connections, and messages.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **JavaFX GUI Development**: Gain proficiency in designing and implementing graphical user interfaces using JavaFX. Learn how to create responsive layouts, handle user input, and manage UI components effectively.

2. **Database Management with PostgreSQL**: Acquire skills in working with relational databases using PostgreSQL. Learn how to design database schemas, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manage database connections within a Java application.

3. **User Authentication and Security**: Understand principles of secure authentication and password encryption. Learn how to implement robust user authentication mechanisms to protect user data and privacy.

4. **Networking and Communication**: Explore concepts of networking and communication within a software application. Understand how to establish connections between users, handle incoming requests, and facilitate real-time messaging functionality.

5. **Project Management with Git**: Develop proficiency in version control and project management using Git and GitHub. Learn how to collaborate effectively, track changes, and manage project tasks within a team environment.
